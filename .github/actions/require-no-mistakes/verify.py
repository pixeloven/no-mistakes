"""Enforce that a pull request was raised through the no-mistakes pipeline.

This is the single shared implementation of the `PR must be raised via
no-mistakes` gate. Enforcing repositories can call the `require-no-mistakes`
composite action instead of copying this logic into their own workflows; the
inline copies drifted (several fleet copies never gained the head_sha bind),
which is exactly what this file exists to prevent.

The verdict is a pure function of the pull request body plus the PR head SHA:

  1. the body carries the no-mistakes signature line;
  2. the body carries a parseable v1 pipeline-step attestation comment;
  3. the attestation's head_sha equals the current PR head SHA, so a later push
     cannot pass on an older attestation;
  4. review, test, and document each recorded status == "completed". Skips
     (quota or agent) and failures are not compliant.

Nothing here reads the repository contents, so a fork's code is never executed.

NON-GOAL: this gate is a CONTRIBUTOR GUARDRAIL, not a forgery-proof security
boundary. The signature line and the attestation are author-editable assertions
published in the PR body, so a hand-written body that reproduces the documented
format passes this check and exits 0. That is a known and accepted limitation,
and a pre-existing one: it is inherited verbatim from the inline gate this file
consolidates, not introduced by consolidating it. What the gate does reliably
catch is the case it exists for - a contributor who bypassed the pipeline by
accident, a malformed or incomplete declaration, and an attestation left stale
by a later push. It authorizes nothing against an author who forges the format
on purpose. Authenticated (signed) attestations are the robust fix and are
tracked separately as backlog item nm-signed-attestations-r1; do not build them
into this file.
